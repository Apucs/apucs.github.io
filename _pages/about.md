I am an NLP Engineer at **Verbex AI**, where I conduct innovative research in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs), multi-agent systems, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation, with a focus on building AI-powered voice agents.

I graduated from **Rajshahi University of Engineering and Technology (RUET)** with a B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering, ranking 9th out of 131 students (CGPA: 3.57/4.00). My research interests span artificial intelligence, with particular focus on:

- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Natural Language Processing
- LLM Security & Generative AI
- Computer Vision
- Object Detection & Face Recognition
- Deep Learning

I am passionate about research, innovative ideas, and developing AI solutions that have real-world impact. You can read more about my research vision in my [research statement](/research-statement/).
